# Space Fixer

## Demo

![Working Demo Gif](images/space_fixer_demo.gif)

## Features

- Hide unexpected gap between widgets

## Getting started

How It Works

![Screenshot How It Works](images/space_fixer.ss.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot How It Works")

Notes:
- **Blue** -> represent background color (eg. listview container's color)
- **Black** -> represent items (eg. listview children widgets)
- **Red** -> represent `SpaceFixerHorizontalLine` (widget to hide unexpected gap)

## Usage

```bash
flutter pub add space_fixer
```

```dart
import 'package:space_fixer/space_fixer.dart';
```

Use these with same color widgets to hide line or space between them:
- `SpaceFixerHorizontalLine()`
- `SpaceFixerVerticalLine()`

Use these with same color widgets inside buttons as they doesn't hide splash: while hiding line or space between them:
- `SpaceFixerHorizontalInkLine()`
- `SpaceFixerVerticalInkLine()`

```dart
class MyPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Container(
          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
          height: 50,
          color: Colors.black,
        ),
        
        SpaceFixerHorizontalLine(         //<------- Notice Here 
          overflowHeight: 3,
          overflowColor: Colors.black,
        ),
        
        Container(
          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
          height: 50,
          color: Colors.black,
        ),
        
      ]
    );
  }
}
```
